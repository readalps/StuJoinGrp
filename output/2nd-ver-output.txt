 Suppose 10 students, denoted by number 0-9, to join some groups such that
 each group can contain at most 5 students and
 for any 2 students, they are both in at least 1 group.
 Please list all kinds of solutions with as few groups as possible.


 Step1. If student A only joins one group then he has at most 4 group-mates;
 and if he joins two groups then he has at most 8 group-mates.
 So for any specific student, to make sure that he has all other 9 students as his group-mates,
 he must join at least 3 groups. And there are 10 of them,
 for any possible group set with x groups, we have 5x >= 30, that is, x >= 6.


 Step2. Now we try to list all the six-group solutions with 1st group [0,1,2,3,4].
